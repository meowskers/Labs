# Docker Examples

This repository contains the examples from the [RCOS Docker talk](http://slides.com/josephlee/docker#/) given by Richi Young, Joseph Lee and Severin Ibarluzea.

Each example in this repository contains a README.md that will walk through a basic docker skill. By going through all the examples, you should be ready to dockerize your first application!
