### Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
It always a good idea to choose a licesense because it protects the coder and the code. Once it is open source the code it free to use, modify and share and no one can claim ownership unjustly. It also means the coder cannot be held liable for copyright, trademark or patent infringement.
### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project htat doesn't have an explicit license?
It is for the flip reason of the last answer. If you choose a project without one and change their code and/or share it you could be sued.
### Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
Yes for the most part Open Source developement is a good idea. Crowd sourceing your idea to lots of different people will yeild alot of different views and if you add them in on editing the code you get lots of more coders.
### Linux uses the GPL v2
Linux uses GPL v2 to protect the code from being owned and not shared and modified. There is a question however why don't they upgrade to v3. One user thinks it because Google which is a big user of the software doesnt want to because it would mean that they couldn't use the software in their android phones: 
######https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1774/why-does-linux-still-use-the-gplv2  

I think this could be and overstatment and that linux the truth is that Linux is doing fine on the v2 and there is no point in rocking the boat.
### GPL vs LGPL vs Apache/BSD
GPL can only interact with other GPL, and must have library released under the GPL as well which means this it good for the common good and developer because it leaves everying open for everyone. LGPL programs linked against a library under LGPL do not need to be released and can be kept proprietary. This is good for companies if they want to keep their library secret as to help them sell there software and make money. Apache/BSD is very free license and is good for very large projects. 
### Create a repository and choose a license
We chose a MIT license because thats what the inital project uses and the LICENSE chooser suggested that we stick to the same one

### Wrtie five sentence about choosing a project to work on in this course, who will be users/customers of such a project, and what license you would choose.
Again the only orginal project that I would can think of would be my "Beir-run" game. It would be a funny and silly game where someone has to collect alcholic drinks and the more you collect the harder the controls get. It would be made for older audiences with a sense of humor due to alcholic drinks.
